# SAT (Session Automation Tool)

SAT (Session Automation Tool) is a Python framework designed to replicate browser sessions from HAR request archives.
## Installation ##

1. Clone this repository using git clone https://github.com/logankaminer/SAT.git.
2. Change the working directory to the cloned repo using cd SAT.
3. Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the dependencies.
4. Use python example.py to run the example file included in the repository.

## Usage ##

SAT is built around the SATFramework class, which is responsible for orchestrating requests and responses. Here's an example of how you can use the framework to automate sessions:

```python

import sat

class MyHook:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @sat.hook("http://example.com")
    def example_hook(self, response):
        print(response.text)

config = sat.Config(
    har_file="path/to/har/file.har",
    hook_class=MyHook,
    silent=True
)

framework = sat.SATFramework(config)
framework.execute()
```

In the above example, we define a hook for http://example.com, which will print out the response text when called. We then create a Config object, which specifies the path to the HAR file, the hook class to use, and a silent flag to suppress output. Finally, we create an instance of the SATFramework class using our Config object and execute the session with framework.execute().

## Hooks ##

Hooks are defined using the @sat.hook decorator. When a request is made to a URL that has a hook defined, the hook function is called with the resulting response object.

```python

@sat.hook("http://example.com")
def my_hook(response):
    print(response.text)
```

In the above example, we define a hook for http://example.com that simply prints out the response text. When a request is made to http://example.com, the my_hook function will be called with the response object.
